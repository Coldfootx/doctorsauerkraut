Clean folder %APPDATA%/LOVE to save some space! This folder is 
for starting directly from code.
 
And clean folder %APPDATA%/gamename or simply /game. This folder is 
for starting from the compiled executable.
 
If you delete the file "randomness" it is regenerated but edit its 
contained number to avoid same map generation. Ideally it should be 
accumulating forever to avoid them.

In Linux look for these
$XDG_DATA_HOME/love/ or ~/.local/share/love/
love may be replaced by game name or simply "game"
